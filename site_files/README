NAME
       site - create an empty website 

SYNOPSIS
       site PROJECTNAME [OPTION]...
       site [-h | -V | -w]

DESCRIPTION
       Creates boilerplate set up files and directories for an apache website using the PROJECTNAME as a common naming convention.  By default this script 
       will create an http configuration file(.conf), a project root directory containing an html directory as the public root, and a directory for log 
       files.  Then apache will be restarted, optionally git will be initialized and optionally a framework will be installed.  Finally file permissions 
       and ownership will be set.  Typically the only other action required will be to update your hosts file.

       Note this script may require granting permissions, such as with sudo.

       -d
              Delete files and directories related to the PROJECTNAME.  Will prompt before deletion.

       -f=FRAMEWORK
              Downloads and installs the latest version of the FRAMEWORK.  The installation is opinionated, such as removing documentation.
              Supported FRAMEWORKs:
              ci     CodeIgniter

       -g
              Initializes git in the project_path root.  Note this setting may be enabled by default via the Configuration wizard.

       -h
              Displays help text(this file).

       -V
              Displays the version number.

       -v
              Enables verbose text.

       -w
              Starts the Configuration wizard.
